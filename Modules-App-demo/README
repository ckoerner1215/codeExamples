In backend directory:
mvn spring-boot:run

This starts the REST API.

In GitBash window, in Amazon Worksapces, create a tunnel:

ssh -L 8081:localhost:8081 <username>@<ip address of govcloud server>

http://localhost:8081/api/modules
(It is not necessary to go to this URL, but if you want to check the modules 
table in the database, you can do it like this.)

port can be changed in backend/src/main/resources/application.properties

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In frontend directory:

npm install
npm update
npm install bootstrap

This will create node_modules directory.  You should only need to do this the first
time you are running the application.

Then, the following command starts the front end application (which accesses the backend):

ng serve

In GitBash window, in Amazon Workspaces, create a tunnel

ssh -L 5555:localhost:5555 <username>@<ip address of govcloud server>

http://localhost:5555

Now, if you go to this URL, you should see the application running, and be able to see all of the modules in the database, and add/delete them also.

Port can be changed in frontend/angular.json
Search for "port" and change the value there.

Also, URLs for the Apis are set in frontend/src/environments/enviroment.ts:

export const environment = {
  production: false,
  backendURL: 'http://localhost:8081/api/modules',
  microserviceURL: 'http://localhost:8888/run',
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:8888',
  fileAccessURL: 'http://localhost:8001'
};


These values can then be accessed in frontend/src/app/services/module.service.ts:

import {environment} from '../../environments/environment'

Use as 
    environment.backendURL
    environment.baseURL



In this directory "Modules-App-demo" I added a Jenkinsfile, and a Dockerfile to the backend directory for the CICD pipeline 
Created a CICD pipeline Job "Module-App-demo", built and pushed both frontend7 and backend images into aws ecr
